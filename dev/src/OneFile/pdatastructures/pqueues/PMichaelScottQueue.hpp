/**
 * <h1> Persistent Michael-Scott Queue </h1>
 *
 * enqueue algorithm: MS enqueue + CR modifications
 * dequeue algorithm: MS dequeue + CR modifications
 * Consistency: Durable Linearizable
 * enqueue() progress: lock-free
 * dequeue() progress: lock-free
 * Memory Reclamation: Hazard Pointers (lock-free)
 *
 * This Queue is a modification to persistence of the original lock-free algorithm
 * by Maged Michael and Michael Scott. We reduced the number of PWB() and PFENCE()
 * as much as possible and we've added the logic for the recovery.
 * The enqueue()/dequeue() methods don't need a recovery method, but the constructor
 * and destructor are (by definition) not lock-free and therefore need to handle
 * proper recovery.
 *
 * To understand what the PWB/PFENCE/PSYNC are, take a look at
 * "Preserving Happens-Before in persistent memory":
 * https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jhi1/papers/2016-spaa-transform
 *
 * We're assuming that CAS has persistent semantics similar to PFENCE() that
 * doesn't act on the load/store of the CAS itself, only on the other loads
 * and stores. In other words, it's as if a CAS is equivalent to a:
 *   PFENCE();
 *   CAS()     // concurrent
 *   PFENCE();
 * The reason we assume this, is because on x86, LOCK instructions and
 * read-modify-write instructions like CAS, ensure order for CLFLUSHOPT and
 * CLWB (PWBs). For more details see Intel's manual for CLFLUSHOPT:
 * https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf
 *
 * This algorithm was designed such that on enqueue(), a successful CAS on ltail->next
 * implies that the PWB()s for newNode->item, newNode->next and tail have been done,
 * and a successful CAS on tail means that the PWB() on ltail->next has been done.
 *
 * As for the PWB() and PSYNC() before returning, they're not always needed but
 * it helps to reason about in terms of composability.
 * The only way to observe effects from this queue is to call enqueue() or
 * dequeue(), therefore, the next call to the same method will flush the cache
 * line and persist it.
 * However, if you want to do something like:
 *   q.enqueue(a);
 *   a_is_persisted = true;
 *   PWB(&a_is_persisted);
 * then the only way to guarantee correct ordering, is to have the PWB() and
 * a PSYNC() or PFENCE() before returning from enqueue()/dequeue().
 *
 * Related to the above, there is a trick on enqueue(). Instead of adding the
 * PWB(&tail) and PSYNC(), we don't do that thanks to happens-before relations.
 * Namely, for enqueue() to return it means the CAS on tail has been done, and
 * although the value of tail may not be persisted, the CAS on tail guarantees
 * that the value of the node->next is persisted. This means that if a crash
 * occurs and even if a_is_persisted is persisted and the change to tail occurring
 * on the enqueue does not, it's still ok because the node->next is persisted
 * which will allow the recover() of the queue to advance the tail and persist
 * it as well.
 * Unfortunately, for the dequeue(), no such trick is possible on the head,
 * therefore, we really do need the PWB(&head) and PSYNC() before returning
 * from dequeue().
 *
 * About the constructor:
 * As long as the allocator returns a zeroed-out memory region, the 'head' and
 * 'tail' will be nullptr even if there is a crash immediately at the start of
 * the call to the constructor. If the allocator can't guarantee that the data
 * is zero-ed out, then there is no 100% safe way to distinguish between a
 * proper initialization and trash immediately after* allocating the queue.
 * A crash occurring after the 'head' and 'tail' are made persistent (with nullptr)
 *is always recoverable, although there are a few different cases:
 * - If the head is nullptr then the sentinel node must be allocated;
 * - If the head is non-null but tail is null, then the sentinel was allocated
 *   and assigned to head but not to tail;
 * - If both head and tail are non-null and tail->next is non-null then tail is
 *   not pointing to the last node and we need to advance tail;
 *
 * About the destructor:
 * The destructor must first drain the queue to avoid leaking as much as possible.
 * Then, it needs to de-allocate the last node and zero-out the head to make
 * sure then in the event of a failure, the recovery operation will not try to
 * "recover" the queue, therefore, we have a persistent variable named 'destructorInProgress'
 * which is set before starting the destruction operation.
 * After destructorInProgress has been set to true and ordered with a PFENCE(),
 * we can clear head, and only then can we de-allocate the last node.
 *
 * All allocation and de-allocation operations in this queue are prone to
 * leaking, if the failure occurs immediately before a de-allocation or
 * immediately after an allocation. There is no way around this problem without
 * transactions, and seen as we're trying to get lock-free progress, the
 * transactional mechanism would have to be also lock-free, and there is no
 * lock-free persistent transactional engine published (yet).
 *
 * Even though this is portable C++ code, this is meant for x86 and may not work correctly on other architectures.
